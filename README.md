## Objective : Developer
   Over past several years my career has evolved from Call Center operator to POS-Terminal Service specialist. During that time I got acquainted with IT technologies and with Microsoft Armenia. I got excited with programming during my first training "Fundamentals of Programming". At present, I'm actively persuing a career as a developer, so I've finished C# trainings at MIC Armenia and grabbed my chance on BetConstruct internship.
   As an active team player, I'm always open to learn and to share knowledge. I hope that my sense of responsibility, hardworking and my ability to find solutions to different situations will be useful for my future work.
